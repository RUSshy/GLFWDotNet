# GLFWDotNet

.NET bindings for [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org).

## Usage

Use one of the following options:

* Compile the GLFWDotNet assembly using Visual Studio or MSBuild.
* Include [GLFW.cs](https://github.com/smack0007/GLFWDotNet/blob/master/Source/Library/GLFWDotNet/GLFW.cs) directly
  in your project.
  
The glfw dlls glfw3_x86.dll and glfw3_x64.dll must be copied into the same directory as your output assemblies.
